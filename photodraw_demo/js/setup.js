      '<p> Welcome to a cogtoolslab demo! This is a minimally working demo of "photodraw", which was designed by Dr. Judith E. Fan and Justin Yang. \
       In this experiment, participants are presented with a photograph and then asked to draw the photographed object on a separate online canvas. \
       What this demo can do: \
       <br> \
       <ul> \
       <li> demonstrate a basic experiment, including instructions, comprehension quiz, 3 trials, and exit survey </li> \
       <li> [if you open the console in your browser] demonstrate what stroke parameters can be collected </li> \
       <li> preview a number of plugin predesigned by <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/">jsPsych</a></li> \
       </ul> \
       What this demo does <b>not</b> do: \
       <br> \
       <ul> \
       <li> collect any participant data </li> \
       <li> present the number of trials normally used in an experiment (the following only contains 3 trials) </li> \
